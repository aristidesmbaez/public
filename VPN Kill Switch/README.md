## VPN Kill Switch
These scripts were created to manually configure firewall rules in macOS and Windows to implement a VPN kill switch. 

The need for this came about when exploring VPN solutions and finding an option that met our needs but that did not have a built in VPN kill switch. A manual solution was created with scripts that adjusted the built in firewall rules to achieve the same effect as a VPN kill switch.

While testing showed the scripts worked as expected we eventually went with a solution that had this feature built in and these scripts were ultimately not used.
