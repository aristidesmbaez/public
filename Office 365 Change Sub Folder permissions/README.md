# Office 365 sub folder permissions
This script was created to resolve an issue with setting share permissions in Exchange Online mailbox folders. At the time this was created if you needed to share a mailbox folder and all its subfolders with another user you needed to manually set the permissions on the folder and all of its subfolders.

This script was designed to be run by an admin and has basic GUI elements for selecting users and folders to streamline the process for admins that may not be familiar with PowerShell.
